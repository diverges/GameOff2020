  Title: The journey begins
  Description: Under the cover of twilight the caravan departed with barely enough
    supplies to make the week-long journey. A silence covered the wagon, its members
    tense wondering if they had done enough to prepare. Their mission is simple-
    deliver the intel contained within the caravan to the Capital. All other forms
    of communication have failed. This small wago and its two volunteers are our
    last hope.
